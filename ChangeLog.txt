Rapid Estimation of Phosphene Threshold (REPT)
----------------------------------------------

version 1.4, 20 Jan 2011
----
* Major: Introduced "Pulse Delay" parameter on GUI. This controls the delay between the pulses. 
         Before it was set to be 1 sec + pulse adjustment time + time for participant to respond (average 2 sec). 
		 Now you can specify the delay manually
